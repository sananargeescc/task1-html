        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.<br> The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

    <p>
        In web development, a back-end developer is responsible for building and maintaining the back end of a website or web application.<br> The back end consists of all components a typical user does not interact with â€” this includes databases, servers, application logic, and APIs.<br> Back-end developers create this infrastructure and work to ensure these components function properly.
